# DataScienceProject_Titanic
This project, carried out in Jupyter Notebook, aims to explore the main Data Analysis techniques with Python tools. 
- Pandas, Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, Plotly and sklearn are used.
Divided into three notebooks, I separate the data cleaning, data analysis and machine learning part.

# How to Use
In this project you will find a .csv file that was used to start the project (titanic.csv) and a preprocessing result file (titanic_preprocessed.csv) and (titanic_preprocessed_2.csv).

The notebook that starts the project is the "Titanic DataSet - Data Cleasing", which generates the titanic_preprocessed.csv, useful for the analysis part.

The notebook "Titanic DataSet - Data Analysis" takes the titanic_preprocessed.csv as input and generates the titanic_preprocessed_2.csv which can later be used in BI platforms like PowerBI as an add-on.

The "Titanic DataSet - Machine Learning" notebook also uses the titanic_preprocessed.csv as input, as the M.L. algorithms used prioritize numerical variables.
